# Solution Steps

1. Define parameters: Set CHUNK_SIZE=200, CHUNK_OVERLAP=40, and TOP_K=5 at the top of the Python file.

2. Implement the chunk_document function to split texts into overlapping chunks using a sliding window approach. Approximate tokens with whitespace-separated words, or use a tokenizer if available.

3. Create process_and_add_documents to loop through all input documents, chunk them, and record category, priority, and date as metadata per chunk. Assign each chunk a unique id.

4. Connect to Chroma, and create/get a collection with the embedding_function set to sentence-transformers. Pass the correct metadata for cosine search ("hnsw:space": "cosine").

5. Add each chunk as a document with associated metadata and id into the Chroma collection. Ensure embedding occurs via the embedding_function.

6. Implement query_retrieve: Given a user query, retrieve top-k=5 most similar chunks from the Chroma collection using cosine distance. Include document text, ids, metadatas, and distances in results.

7. Define assemble_response: Merge retrieved chunks, filter dupe/overlap, and for each chunk, append the passage plus a [Category | Date] citation. Join these for the final answer.

8. In the __main__ section, simulate a set of sample support documents covering multiple topics. Populate Chroma freshly using process_and_add_documents.

9. Run a set of sample queries, invoking query_retrieve and assemble_response, and print out the results for manual spot checking.

10. Evaluate recall@k for the queries by checking if the correct answer's keyword appears in the top-k retrieved chunks, demonstrating improved retrieval.

11. Document the code and ensure all functions are properly connected for end-to-end chunking, metadata persistence, retrieval, and context assembly.
